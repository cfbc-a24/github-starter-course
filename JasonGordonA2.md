# Learning Takeaways

## What did I learn?
I've previously used Git and Github (after all, I graduated majoring in Computer Science), but it's been quite some time since I've interacted with the system in a code way. I usually use it as a public archive for PDFs for my resume.

However, having this to use again is very nice! I'm excited to see what comes next.

## Who am I?
I'm an incoming CIR student that is looking to learn a bit more about data science and refresh myself in the world of coding! For most of my research, I use *glorious spreadsheets* which are lovely, but difficult if I need to do really heavy data science. I'm looking to get some more quantitative methods so I can more easily analyze lots of data.

Outside of class, I enjoy baking and often also just keep up with the horse race that is politics (although, I don't focus on American politics for my research. That makes me sad.)
